  abstract = {To compare entire genomes from different species, biologists increasingly
	need alignment methods that are efficient enough to handle long sequences,
	and accurate enough to correctly align the conserved biological features
	between distant species. We present LAGAN, a system for rapid global
	alignment of two homologous genomic sequences, and Multi-LAGAN, a
	system for multiple global alignment of genomic sequences. We tested
	our systems on a data set consisting of greater than 12 Mb of high-quality
	sequence from 12 vertebrate species. All the sequence was derived
	from the genomic region orthologous to an approximately 1.5-Mb region
	on human chromosome 7q31.3. We found that both LAGAN and Multi-LAGAN
	compare favorably with other leading alignment methods in correctly
	aligning protein-coding exons, especially between distant homologs
	such as human and chicken, or human and fugu. Multi-LAGAN produced
	the most accurate alignments, while requiring just 75 minutes on
	a personal computer to obtain the multiple alignment of all 12 sequences.
	Multi-LAGAN is a practical method for generating multiple alignments
	of long genomic sequences at any evolutionary distance. Our systems
	are publicly available at http://lagan.stanford.edu.},

  abstract = {The use of novel algorithmic techniques is pivotal to many important
	problems in life science. For example the sequencing of the human
	genome 1 would not have been possible without advanced assembly algorithms.
	However, owing to the high speed of technological progress and the
	urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there is a widening gap between
	state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic
	components of tools that are in widespread use.To remedy this trend
	we propose the use of SeqAn, a library of efficient data types and
	algorithms for sequence analysis in computational biology. SeqAn
	comprises implementations of existing, practical state-of-the-art
	algorithmic components to provide a sound basis for algorithm testing
	and development. In this paper we describe the design and content
	of SeqAn and demonstrate its use by giving two examples. In the first
	example we show an application of SeqAn as an experimental platform
	by comparing different exact string matching algorithms. The second
	example is a simple version of the well-known MUMmer tool rewritten
	in SeqAn. Results indicate that our implementation is very efficient
	and versatile to use.We anticipate that SeqAn greatly simplifies
	the rapid development of new bioinformatics tools by providing a
	collection of readily usable, well-designed algorithmic components
	which are fundamental for the field of sequence analysis. This leverages
	not only the implementation of new algorithms, but also enables a
	sound analysis and comparison of existing algorithms.},

abstract ={Motivation: Next generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized biomedical research in the last decade and led to a continues stream of developments in bioinformatics addressing the need for fast and space efficient solutions for analyzing NGS data. Often researchers need to analyze a set of genomic sequences which stem from closely related species or are indeed individuals of the same species. Hence the analyzed sequences are very similar. For analyses where local changes in the examined sequence induce only local changes in the results it is obviously desirable to examine identical or similar regions not repeatedly.Results: In this work we provide a datatype which exploits data parallelism inherent in a set of similar sequences by analyzing shared regions only once. In real-world experiments we show that algorithms which otherwise would scan each reference sequentially can be speeded up by a factor of 115.Availability: Availability: The data structure and associated tools are publicly available at http://www.seqan.de/projects/jst and are part of SeqAn, the C++ template library for sequence analysis.Contact: rene.rahn@fu-berlin.de, knut.reinert@fu-berlin.de},
